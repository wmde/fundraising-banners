		<strong>We're so grateful for your amazing support!<br>Nonetheless, we're sorry to report that, for the very
			first time, we didn't reach our donation goal.</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		Wikipedia itself doesn't generate a single cent, has no ads and is free for all to use. That's why we rely so
		heavily on our yearly donation campaign. This year about 20,000 fewer people made donations than in previous
		years, a fact we view in the context of a world in full-on crisis mode: So much is unstable, and we're
		questioning much that we thought was certain. It's all more than a little unsettling. That's why right now
		it's crucial that Wikipedia brave the growing polarization, disinformation and manipulation of our modern
		world. Your supporting membership helps provide Wikipedia with financial stability.

		In times like these, Wikipedia is so valuable because it's a place where people of vastly different viewpoints
		still hold conversations -- frequently controversial ones, but ones that stay within the rules. Participants
		debate content, sources and wording in an open and transparent way. At times all that can be tedious, not to
		mention exhausting. But it's that very process that allows the creation of verified, neutral and trustworthy
		information. Nobody has the power to declare what should be in Wikipedia – neither billionaires nor the powers
		that be. And because it's an independent and collaborative project, it can't be bought up by someone and
		destroyed. That's what Wikipedia stands for – as do we, the charitable organization behind this marvelous project.

	<p>
		One of the pillars of content independence is <strong>financial independence</strong>. That we fell short this
		year makes it especially clear: Now more than ever, Wikipedia depends on <strong>regular support</strong> from
		dedicated supporters who can help protect this one-of-a-kind place of democracy on the internet. And yet,
		given how beloved Wikipedia is across the world, those protectors are still very few and far between.
	</p>

	<p>
		That's why we're asking you to <strong>join this community of Wikipedia enthusiasts</strong> and to help us
		handle, among other things, the many current technological challenges we face.
